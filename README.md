# Food Finder #
This is the first project assigned to our class at Wyncode Academy. After learning about Ruby data types and basic functions during the first week, we had three days to create a __REPL__ game. REPL stands for __Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop__, and we were advised to keep the scope small enough to complete. We were encouraged to make it as modular as possible, as __DRY__ (Don't Repeat Yourself) code is what every developer should strive to create.

As an example, we created a simple game in class where the player was Batman, and they chose their sidekick (Robin or Batgirl), gave their sidekick a weapon, and fought with criminals. This set expectations for what our games should be able to do, as well how to go about writing the game.

The game I came up with was one where you are in class late at night working on a group project, and everyone is really hungry. But are there any restaurants still open?! Choose your restaurant, how you'll get the food, food quantity, food toppings and modifiers, and see how your group reacts to your choices!

### How To Play ###
